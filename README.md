Flight Delay Prediction 

An advanced flight delay prediction model using Linear and Random Forest Regression and AdaBoost, achieving 92% accuracy by analyzing a dataset of 4 million flights from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Addressed the "Knock-on" effect by designing a predictive tool utilizing logistic regression, and ensemble techniques to capture complex relationships and patterns.
